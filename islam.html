        <h1>Islam</h1>
        <p>Islam is a major world religion founded in the 7th century CE, based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. It emphasizes submission to God, moral living, and community.</p>

    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Islam began in the early 7th century in Mecca, present-day Saudi Arabia, with the revelations received by the Prophet Muhammad from Allah (God). These revelations were later compiled into the Qur’an, the holy book of Islam. Muhammad's teachings spread throughout the Arabian Peninsula and, after his death, expanded rapidly across Asia, Africa, and Europe, forming a major religious, cultural, and political civilization.
