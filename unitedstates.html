    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
        The United States is the third-largest country in the world by area, covering approximately 9.8 million 
        square kilometers. Its geography is incredibly diverse, featuring mountains, plains, deserts, forests, 
        rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. This variety has influenced settlement patterns, agriculture, industry, 
        and culture across the country.
    </p>

    <h3>Regions</h3>

    <section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        The history of the United States spans thousands of years, from the time of Indigenous peoples 
        to the modern era. The country’s history is marked by exploration, colonization, independence, 
        conflict, expansion, and the development of a democratic society.
    </p>

    <h3>Pre-Colonial and Indigenous Peoples</h3>
    <p>
        Before European settlement, North America was home to diverse Indigenous nations and cultures, 
        including the Iroquois, Cherokee, Sioux, Navajo, and many others. These societies had complex 
        social structures, trade networks, and rich traditions of art, religion, and governance.
    </p>

    <h3>Colonial Period (1607–1776)</h3>
    <p>
        European settlers, primarily from Britain, Spain, and France, established colonies along the 
        Atlantic coast. British colonies grew rapidly, with economies based on agriculture, trade, 
        and slavery. Conflicts with Indigenous peoples and European powers shaped early colonial life.
    </p>

    <h3>American Revolution (1775–1783)</h3>
    <p>
        Tensions between the British crown and the American colonies led to the Revolutionary War. 
        Key events include the Declaration of Independence in 1776, battles such as Lexington and Concord, 
        and the eventual victory of the colonies, leading to the formation of the United States.
    </p>

    <h3>Formation of Government (1787–1800)</h3>
    <p>
        The US Constitution was drafted in 1787, establishing a federal government with separation of 
        powers. George Washington became the first President in 1789. The Bill of Rights guaranteed 
        fundamental liberties and shaped American democracy.
    </p>

    <h3>Civil War and Reconstruction (1861–1877)</h3>
    <p>
        The Civil War erupted over slavery and states’ rights, pitting the Union (North) against the 
        Confederacy (South). Key events include the Emancipation Proclamation and major battles such 
        as Gettysburg. The North’s victory preserved the Union, ended slavery, and led to the 
        Reconstruction era, focusing on rebuilding the South and securing civil rights for freed slaves.
    </p>

    <h3>Industrialization and Expansion (1877–1920)</h3>
    <p>
        Rapid industrial growth, urbanization, and westward expansion characterized this period. Railroads, 
        factories, and natural resource extraction fueled economic growth. Immigration from Europe and 
        Asia increased cultural diversity, while Native Americans faced displacement.
    </p>

    <h3>World Wars and the 20th Century</h3>
    <p>
        The US played major roles in World War I and World War II, emerging as a global economic and 
        military power. The Cold War (1947–1991) involved political and military tensions with the Soviet 
        Union. Civil rights movements in the 1950s and 1960s sought racial equality and social justice.
    </p>

    <h3>Modern Era (1991–Present)</h3>
    <p>
        In recent decades, the US has faced challenges including terrorism, economic recessions, 
        technological transformation, and political polarization. The country continues to influence 
        global affairs, trade, technology, and culture while addressing domestic issues such as healthcare, 
        immigration, and social inequality.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> The history of the United States is a story of exploration, struggle, 
        innovation, and growth. From Indigenous civilizations and colonial settlements to independence, 
        civil conflict, industrialization, world leadership, and modern social and political developments, 
        the US has evolved into a diverse and influential nation with a rich historical legacy.

<!-- Government -->
<section id="government">
    <h2>Government</h2>
    <p>
        The United States operates as a federal republic with a democratic system. Its government is based 
        on the Constitution, which establishes the rule of law, separation of powers, and protection of citizens' 
        rights. Power is shared between the national (federal) government and individual state governments.
    </p>

    <h3>Federal Structure</h3>
    <p>
        The federal government has authority over national matters such as defense, foreign policy, and 
        currency, while states manage local affairs including education, law enforcement, and transportation. 
        Each state has its own constitution, legislature, executive branch (governor), and judicial system.
    </p>

    <h3>Three Branches of Government</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Executive Branch:</strong> Headed by the President, this branch enforces laws, directs 
            foreign policy, commands the military, and oversees federal agencies.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legislative Branch:</strong> Congress, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives, 
            makes laws, controls federal spending, and has the power to declare war and approve treaties.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Judicial Branch:</strong> Led by the Supreme Court, it interprets laws, ensures they 
            comply with the Constitution, and resolves disputes between states or individuals and the government.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Checks and Balances</h3>
    <p>
        The US government is designed with a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch 
        from becoming too powerful. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Congress can pass laws, but the President can veto them.</li>
        <li>The Supreme Court can declare laws or executive actions unconstitutional.</li>
        <li>The Senate confirms judicial appointments and cabinet members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>State and Local Governments</h3>
    <p>
        Each state has a government similar to the federal structure, including executive, legislative, 
        and judicial branches. Local governments, such as counties and cities, manage community services, 
        schools, public safety, and zoning regulations. This decentralized system allows regions to address 
        specific needs while remaining part of a unified nation.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> The United States government is a democratic federal republic with a strong 
        system of checks and balances. Power is shared between national and state governments, and citizens 
        have rights and responsibilities protected by the Constitution. The three branches—executive, legislative, 
        and judicial—work together to maintain a stable and fair governance system.

    <!-- Environment -->
   <section id="environment">
    <h2>Environment</h2>
    <p>
        The United States is home to a wide variety of ecosystems, ranging from dense forests in the Pacific Northwest and the Appalachian Mountains to arid deserts in the Southwest, expansive wetlands in the Southeast, and rugged coastal areas along both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. This diversity of landscapes supports a rich variety of plant and animal life, making the country one of the most ecologically diverse in the world. 
    </p>
    <p>
        National parks, wildlife refuges, and protected areas play a crucial role in preserving this biodiversity. Famous parks such as Yellowstone, Yosemite, the Everglades, and the Grand Canyon not only protect unique ecosystems but also provide spaces for research, recreation, and environmental education. Conservation efforts also extend to endangered species, forest management, and wetland restoration projects, reflecting the country’s commitment to maintaining ecological balance. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Despite these protections, the United States faces several significant environmental challenges. Pollution from industrial, agricultural, and urban sources affects air, water, and soil quality. Climate change is leading to rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and shifts in ecosystems, affecting both wildlife and human communities.
