            <section id="socrates">
                <h2>Socrates</h2>
                <p>Socrates (469–399 BCE) was a classical Greek philosopher credited as a founder of Western philosophy. He focused on ethics and human behavior through dialogue and questioning, known as the Socratic Method.</p>
                <blockquote>"The unexamined life is not worth living." – Socrates</blockquote>
                <p>He believed that knowledge and virtue were closely connected and that self-awareness was the path to wisdom.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="plato">
                <h2>Plato</h2>
                <p>Plato (427–347 BCE), a student of Socrates, founded the Academy in Athens. He wrote philosophical dialogues exploring justice, politics, and reality.</p>
                <blockquote>"Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something." – Plato</blockquote>
                <p>Plato's works introduced concepts like the Theory of Forms, describing ideal versions of reality, influencing philosophy, politics, and education for centuries.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="aristotle">
                <h2>Aristotle</h2>
                <p>Aristotle (384–322 BCE), a student of Plato, focused on logic, ethics, science, and politics. His writings form the foundation of many modern disciplines.</p>
                <blockquote>"Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." – Aristotle</blockquote>
                <p>Aristotle emphasized empirical observation and categorization, and his concept of virtue ethics remains influential today.</p>
