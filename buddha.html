        <h2>Life of Buddha</h2>
        <p>
            Siddhartha Gautama was born around the 5th–4th century BCE in Lumbini, present-day Nepal, into a royal family. Despite his privileged life, he was deeply affected by the suffering he observed in the world, including sickness, aging, and death. Seeking understanding and liberation, he left his palace in pursuit of enlightenment. After years of meditation and spiritual practice, he attained enlightenment under the Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya, India, becoming the Buddha, meaning “the awakened one.” He spent the rest of his life teaching the path to liberation and helping others overcome suffering.

        <h2>Core Teachings</h2>
        <p>
            Buddha’s teachings center on understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation. The foundation of his philosophy includes the Four Noble Truths and the concepts of impermanence, non-self, and dependent origination.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Four Noble Truths:</strong> 
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Dukkha:</strong> Life involves suffering and dissatisfaction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Samudaya:</strong> Suffering arises from attachment, craving, and desire.</li>
                    <li><strong>Nirodha:</strong> Suffering can cease by overcoming desire and attachment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Magga:</strong> There is a path that leads to the cessation of suffering.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Impermanence (Anicca):</strong> Everything in life is transient and constantly changing.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Self (Anatta):</strong> There is no permanent, unchanging self; identity is a collection of experiences and conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependent Origination (Pratītyasamutpāda):</strong> All phenomena arise in dependence upon causes and conditions.</li>
