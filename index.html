    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar, also known as Burma, is a country located in Southeast Asia, bordered by 
        India and Bangladesh to the west, China to the north and northeast, Laos and Thailand 
        to the east and southeast, and the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the south and southwest. 
        The country covers an area of approximately 676,000 square kilometers, making it the 
        largest country in mainland Southeast Asia.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mountains:</strong> Myanmar is a mountainous country, especially in the north and west. 
        The northern region features the Himalayan foothills and the Kachin Hills, including 
        the Hkakabo Razi, which is the highest peak in Myanmar and Southeast Asia at 5,881 meters. 
        In the west, the Arakan Mountains (Rakhine Yoma) run parallel to the coast. The Shan Plateau 
        in the east is a highland region with rolling hills and deep valleys. These mountains 
        influence the climate and river systems of the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rivers:</strong> Myanmar has many important rivers that sustain its agriculture, 
        transportation, and ecosystems. The <strong>Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River</strong> is the 
        main river, flowing from north to south through the central plains and emptying into the 
        Andaman Sea. The <strong>Chindwin River</strong>, the largest tributary of the Ayeyarwady, 
        flows through the northwestern region. Other major rivers include the <strong>Salween River</strong>, 
        which runs along the eastern border with Thailand, and the <strong>Mali and N’Mai Rivers</strong> 
        in Kachin State, which merge to form the Ayeyarwady. These rivers support rich biodiversity 
        and fertile farmlands.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Plains:</strong> The central region of Myanmar consists of fertile plains along the 
        Ayeyarwady River. This area is the heart of agriculture, producing rice, pulses, and vegetables. 
        It is also home to most of the country’s population, including major cities like Mandalay 
        and Yangon. The plains are relatively flat, surrounded by mountains on all sides, which 
        provides natural protection and a favorable environment for farming.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Climate:</strong> Myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by three main seasons. 
        The <em>hot season</em> occurs from March to May, with temperatures often exceeding 35°C. 
        The <em>rainy season</em>, caused by the southwest monsoon, lasts from June to October, bringing 
        heavy rainfall, especially to coastal and northern mountainous areas. The <em>cool season</em> 
        occurs from November to February, with milder temperatures and drier weather. The northern 
        highlands experience cooler climates, while the southern coastal regions are warm and humid 
        year-round.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Regions:</strong> Myanmar can be divided into several geographic regions. The <em>northern 
        mountains</em> include the Himalayan foothills and Kachin Hills. The <em>central plains</em> along 
        the Ayeyarwady are the agricultural heartland. The <em>eastern Shan Plateau</em> is hilly and less 
        populated. The <em>western coastal strip</em> includes the Rakhine coast and the Arakan Mountains. 
        The <em>southern peninsula</em> is narrow, tropical, and rich in forests, beaches, and islands. 
        These regions influence the economy, culture, and settlement patterns of the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s geography is diverse, from towering mountains and highlands to fertile plains, 
        long rivers, and tropical coasts. This diversity affects the climate, population distribution, 
        agriculture, and transportation networks, making Myanmar a country with unique natural and cultural 
        landscapes.

    <section id="ethnic-groups">
    <h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Southeast Asia, with over 
        135 recognized ethnic groups. These groups are broadly categorized into eight major 
        “national races,” each with distinct languages, traditions, and cultures. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Bamar (Burman):</strong> The Bamar people are the largest ethnic group, 
        making up about two-thirds of the population. They primarily live in the central plains 
        along the Ayeyarwady River. The Bamar language is the official language of Myanmar, 
        and their culture heavily influences the country’s traditions, Buddhism, and governance. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Shan:</strong> The Shan are a Tai ethnic group living mainly in Shan State in 
        the northeast. They speak the Shan language and practice Theravada Buddhism. Shan culture 
        includes colorful festivals, traditional music, and hilltop villages surrounded by rice fields. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Karen (Kayin):</strong> The Karen people are concentrated in Kayin State in 
        southeastern Myanmar. Major subgroups include the Sgaw and Pwo. The Karen language has 
        several dialects, and Christianity and Buddhism are both practiced among them. The Karen 
        have a strong tradition of weaving, folk songs, and oral storytelling. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rakhine (Arakanese):</strong> Rakhine people live along the western coast in 
        Rakhine State. They speak the Rakhine language, a dialect of Burmese, and follow 
        Theravada Buddhism. Rakhine culture includes distinctive architecture, traditional festivals, 
        and coastal fishing practices. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mon:</strong> The Mon people live mainly in Mon State in the southeast. 
        They are one of the earliest groups to adopt Theravada Buddhism in Myanmar. 
        The Mon language has its own script, and Mon culture includes classical dance, music, 
        and temple architecture. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kachin:</strong> The Kachin people live in the northernmost Kachin State. 
        Subgroups include Jingpo and Rawang. They speak various languages and practice Christianity 
        and traditional animist beliefs. Kachin culture includes festivals, traditional dress, 
        and weaving. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Chin:</strong> The Chin people live mainly in Chin State in the west. 
        They speak multiple languages and dialects, and many practice Christianity. 
        Chin culture emphasizes handicrafts, weaving, and traditional ceremonies. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kayah (Karenni):</strong> Kayah people live in Kayah State in eastern Myanmar. 
        Subgroups include Kayah and Padaung. They are known for their distinctive woven textiles, 
        traditional houses, and cultural festivals. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Other smaller ethnic groups include the Wa, Lisu, Pa-O, Danu, Gurkha, and many more, 
        each with unique languages, clothing, festivals, and traditions. Many ethnic groups 
        celebrate annual harvest festivals, maintain traditional weaving and handicraft skills, 
        and preserve oral histories and folk songs. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s ethnic diversity creates a rich tapestry of languages, customs, 
        religions, and traditions. This diversity influences the country’s festivals, clothing, 
        cuisine, and social life, making Myanmar culturally vibrant and unique.

    <section id="cities">
    <h2>Cities</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar has several major cities, each with unique roles in politics, culture, trade, 
        and history. These cities are centers of population, administration, commerce, and culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Naypyidaw:</strong> Naypyidaw is the capital city of Myanmar, officially designated 
        in 2005. Located in the central part of the country, it is known for its wide roads, 
        modern government buildings, and planned layout. Naypyidaw serves as the political and 
        administrative center, housing the parliament, ministries, and embassies. Despite its 
        size, the city has a relatively low population density compared to Yangon or Mandalay.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Yangon:</strong> Yangon, formerly Rangoon, is Myanmar’s largest city and 
        commercial hub. Located near the Yangon River in the south, it has the busiest seaport, 
        international airports, and a strong business sector. Yangon is famous for the 
        <em>Shwedagon Pagoda</em>, colonial architecture, bustling markets, and diverse population. 
        It is a center of culture, education, and trade.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mandalay:</strong> Mandalay, in central Myanmar, is the country’s second-largest 
        city and cultural heart. It was the last royal capital before British colonization. 
        Mandalay is known for its monasteries, universities, crafts, and arts, especially 
        gold leaf production and traditional weaving. It is a gateway to northern Myanmar, 
        including the Shan and Kachin regions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Other notable cities:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mawlamyine:</strong> Located in Mon State, it is known for colonial 
                architecture, river ports, and nearby beaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Taunggyi:</strong> Capital of Shan State, famous for the annual 
                <em>Hot Air Balloon Festival</em> and nearby Inle Lake.</li>
            <li><strong>Pyay:</strong> Historical city in the central plains, with ancient 
                Pyu ruins and fertile farmland.</li>
            <li><strong>Myitkyina:</strong> Capital of Kachin State in the north, important 
                for trade and river transport along the Irrawaddy and N’Mai rivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Bago:</strong> Located near Yangon, historically significant as a 
                former Mon kingdom with famous pagodas.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s cities vary from political capitals and commercial hubs to 
        cultural centers and historic towns. Together, they form the backbone of the 
        country’s administration, economy, and cultural identity.
    </p>

<section id="history">
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar, historically known as Burma, has a long and rich history that spans thousands of years. 
        Its history is marked by powerful kingdoms, colonial influence, struggles for independence, 
        and modern political transformations.
    </p>

    <h3>Ancient Kingdoms</h3>
    <p>
        The earliest civilizations in Myanmar were the Pyu city-states, which existed from around 
        200 BCE to 900 CE in the central plains. The Pyu were skilled in trade, agriculture, and 
        Buddhism. They established fortified cities like Sri Ksetra and Halin, and their influence 
        extended to neighboring regions. The Pyu culture laid the foundation for the Burmese language, 
        writing system, and early Buddhist traditions.
    </p>

    <p>
        After the decline of the Pyu, the Mon people emerged as a dominant power in Lower Myanmar 
        around the 9th to 11th centuries. The Mon established important cities such as Thaton 
        and Pegu (Bago) and played a significant role in spreading Theravada Buddhism, 
        which remains the dominant religion in Myanmar today.
    </p>

    <p>
        The most famous ancient kingdom was the Bagan Kingdom, which rose in the 9th century and 
        reached its peak between the 11th and 13th centuries. Bagan became a major center of 
        culture, religion, and trade. The kings of Bagan built over 10,000 Buddhist temples, 
        stupas, and monasteries across the plains, many of which still stand today. This era 
        is considered a golden age of Burmese civilization, with advancements in architecture, 
        art, literature, and governance.
    </p>

    <h3>Colonial Period (British Rule)</h3>
    <p>
        In the 19th century, Myanmar faced increasing pressure from the British Empire. After 
        three Anglo-Burmese wars (1824–1826, 1852, and 1885), Burma was fully annexed and became 
        a province of British India. The colonial period introduced modern infrastructure, 
        education systems, and new trade opportunities, but it also caused social disruption, 
        land confiscation, and exploitation of local resources. Resistance movements and 
        nationalist sentiments began to grow during this time, laying the foundation for the 
        independence struggle.
    </p>

    <h3>Independence and Modern History</h3>
    <p>
        During World War II, Myanmar became a battleground between Allied forces and the Japanese. 
        Nationalist leaders, such as General Aung San, initially allied with Japan but later joined 
        the Allies to fight for independence. After the war, Aung San negotiated with the British 
        for Burmese self-rule. Tragically, he was assassinated in 1947, just months before independence.
    </p>

    <p>
        Myanmar officially gained independence on January 4, 1948, becoming the Union of Burma. 
        The early years were marked by democracy, but the country soon faced internal conflicts, 
        including ethnic insurgencies and political instability. In 1962, a military coup brought 
        the country under direct military rule, which lasted for decades and influenced politics, 
        economy, and society.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Leaders and Events</h3>
    <p>
        - <strong>General Aung San:</strong> Father of modern Myanmar, led the independence movement 
          and negotiated freedom from British rule.  
        - <strong>U Nu:</strong> First Prime Minister of independent Burma, led democratic governance 
          in the 1950s.  
        - <strong>Ne Win:</strong> Military leader who took power in 1962 and implemented the “Burmese Way 
          to Socialism,” nationalizing industries and limiting foreign investment.  
        - <strong>1988 Pro-Democracy Uprising:</strong> Widespread protests against military rule were 
          violently suppressed, but it marked the rise of Aung San Suu Kyi as a democratic leader.  
        - <strong>2010–2015 Political Reforms:</strong> Transition toward partial civilian government, 
          lifting some restrictions on freedom and opening up the economy.  
        - <strong>Aung San Suu Kyi:</strong> Nobel Peace Prize laureate and leader of the National 
          League for Democracy, symbolizing the struggle for democracy.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Today, Myanmar continues to navigate challenges in governance, ethnic reconciliation, and 
        economic development, while its long history of kingdoms, colonial influence, and independence 
        movements shape its modern identity.
    </p>
</section>
<section id="culture">
    <h2>Culture and Traditions</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar has a rich and diverse culture shaped by its history, ethnic diversity, and religious traditions. 
        Cultural practices vary across regions, but certain elements are shared widely across the country.
    </p>

    <h3>Religion</h3>
    <p>
        Religion plays a central role in Myanmar’s culture and daily life. The majority of the population 
        practices <strong>Theravada Buddhism</strong>, which influences architecture, festivals, morality, 
        and education. Temples, pagodas, and monasteries are found throughout the country, with the 
        <em>Shwedagon Pagoda</em> in Yangon being the most iconic. Monks hold a respected place in society, 
        and many young boys temporarily become monks to study religion and ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other religions include <strong>Christianity</strong>, practiced mainly by ethnic groups such as the 
        Kachin, Chin, and Karen, and <strong>Islam</strong> among the Rohingya and other communities. 
        Traditional <strong>Animist beliefs</strong> are also present, often integrated with Buddhism, 
        and involve rituals, spirits, and local customs that honor nature and ancestors.
    </p>

    <h3>Festivals</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar’s festivals are colorful, lively, and often tied to the Buddhist calendar. 
        The most famous festival is <strong>Thingyan</strong>, the Water Festival, held in April 
        to celebrate the Burmese New Year. During Thingyan, people splash water on each other to 
        cleanse bad luck and start the new year fresh. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Thadingyut</strong>, the Festival of Lights, marks the end of Buddhist Lent in October. 
        During this festival, homes and streets are decorated with candles and lanterns, and people 
        pay respect to elders and teachers.  
        Ethnic groups also celebrate their own festivals, such as the <strong>Shan festivals</strong> 
        in Shan State, which include traditional music, dances, sports, and agricultural celebrations.  
        These festivals strengthen community bonds and preserve ethnic traditions.
    </p>

    <h3>Clothing, Arts, and Traditional Music/Dance</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional clothing in Myanmar varies by region and ethnicity. The <strong>longyi</strong> 
        (a cylindrical skirt worn by men and women) is common nationwide. Ethnic groups have their 
        own distinctive dress, patterns, and textiles, often worn during festivals and ceremonies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Myanmar’s arts include painting, sculpture, lacquerware, wood carving, and weaving. Temples 
        and pagodas are decorated with intricate carvings and murals depicting Buddhist stories. 
        Handicrafts from different ethnic groups, such as Mon, Shan, and Chin, preserve ancient 
        techniques and cultural heritage.
    </p>
    <p>
        Traditional music involves instruments like the <strong>saung (harp)</strong>, <strong>pattala (xylophone)</strong>, 
        and drums, used in religious ceremonies, folk songs, and celebrations. Dance is often tied to 
        storytelling and religious rituals, with movements and costumes reflecting local customs and 
        historical legends.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s culture and traditions are a vibrant blend of religious devotion, ethnic 
        diversity, and artistic expression. Festivals, clothing, arts, music, and dance continue to 
        connect the people to their history, beliefs, and community life.
    </p>

<section id="economy">
    <h2>Economy</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar’s economy is diverse, shaped by its natural resources, agriculture, industry, and 
        strategic location in Southeast Asia. The country has a mix of traditional sectors and 
        emerging modern industries, though it faces challenges such as political instability, 
        infrastructure gaps, and fluctuating global markets.
    </p>

    <h3>Agriculture</h3>
    <p>
        Agriculture is the backbone of Myanmar’s economy, employing the majority of the population. 
        The central plains along the Ayeyarwady River provide fertile land for crops. 
        <strong>Rice</strong> is the main staple and export crop, particularly in the delta region. 
        Other important crops include <strong>pulses, beans, sugarcane, sesame, and peanuts</strong>. 
        Myanmar is also known for producing high-quality <strong>teak wood</strong>, a valuable export. 
        Livestock, fisheries, and aquaculture are additional contributors to the agricultural sector.
    </p>

    <h3>Industry and Trade</h3>
    <p>
        Industrial development in Myanmar is gradually expanding. Key industries include 
        <strong>textiles, food processing, cement, mining, and construction materials</strong>. 
        The garment industry has grown as an export-oriented sector, particularly to Asian and 
        European markets. Trade is an important part of the economy, with Myanmar exporting 
        agricultural products, timber, gemstones, and natural resources, while importing machinery, 
        electronics, and consumer goods.
    </p>

    <h3>Natural Resources</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar is rich in natural resources. It has substantial reserves of <strong>oil and natural gas</strong>, 
        which are exported to neighboring countries like China, Thailand, and India. Gemstones, 
        especially rubies, sapphires, and jade, are major exports and a source of national income. 
        The country is also abundant in <strong>forests</strong>, providing teak and other hardwoods, 
        as well as biodiversity. Other minerals include copper, tin, lead, and zinc, though 
        mining is often concentrated in specific regions and requires careful management.
    </p>

    <h3>Major Ports and Trade Routes</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar’s strategic location connects the Indian Ocean to Southeast Asia. Major ports 
        include <strong>Yangon Port</strong>, the largest commercial port, handling imports and exports, 
        and <strong>Mawlamyine Port</strong> in Mon State. The country is also developing 
        <strong>Thilawa Special Economic Zone</strong> near Yangon to attract investment and enhance trade. 
        Inland waterways, such as the Ayeyarwady River, serve as important trade and transportation routes. 
        Overland connections with Thailand, China, and India facilitate regional trade, making Myanmar 
        a key part of the East-West and North-South economic corridors.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s economy is a combination of traditional agriculture, growing industries, 
        abundant natural resources, and strategic trade routes. While challenges remain, the country 
        has significant potential for growth, investment, and regional integration.
    </p>

<section id="government">
    <h2>Government and Politics</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar’s government and political system are shaped by a combination of democratic structures 
        and significant military influence. The country has a long history of governance challenges, 
        from ancient kingdoms to colonial rule, military regimes, and ongoing efforts toward democratic reform.
    </p>

    <h3>Current Political System</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar is officially a republic with a parliamentary system, but the military retains considerable 
        power under the 2008 Constitution. The government consists of three branches: the executive, 
        legislative, and judiciary. The <strong>legislature (Pyidaungsu Hluttaw)</strong> is bicameral, 
        with the House of Representatives (Pyithu Hluttaw) and the House of Nationalities (Amyotha Hluttaw). 
        The President is the head of state and government, elected by the legislature. 
        Despite the formal democratic structure, the military (Tatmadaw) controls 25% of parliamentary seats 
        and key ministries such as defense, border affairs, and home affairs, which gives it veto power 
        over constitutional changes and significant influence in governance.
    </p>

    <h3>Administrative Divisions</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar is divided into <strong>seven states and seven regions</strong>, along with the union 
        territories of Naypyidaw and certain self-administered zones. 
        - <strong>States</strong> are areas predominantly inhabited by ethnic minorities, such as Shan, Kachin, 
        Kayin, Chin, Mon, Kayah, and Rakhine.  
        - <strong>Regions</strong> are mainly inhabited by the Bamar majority, including Yangon, Mandalay, 
        Magway, Sagaing, Bago, and Ayeyarwady.  
        Each state and region has its own local government, led by a chief minister, and local legislative 
        bodies. Self-administered zones and divisions allow some ethnic groups limited autonomy, 
        reflecting the country’s ethnic diversity.
    </p>

    <h3>Role of Ethnic Groups in Politics</h3>
    <p>
        Ethnic groups play a central role in Myanmar’s political landscape. Many ethnic minorities have 
        formed political parties and armed organizations seeking greater autonomy, cultural recognition, 
        and participation in governance. The <strong>National League for Democracy (NLD)</strong> and 
        other parties often engage in negotiations with ethnic groups to form coalitions or peace agreements. 
        Historical tensions, however, have led to prolonged armed conflicts in several regions, particularly 
        in Kachin, Shan, and Rakhine states.
    </p>
    <p>
        The military also justifies its role as a stabilizing force to maintain national unity among 
        diverse ethnic groups. Ethnic representation in the legislature, self-administered zones, and 
        peace agreements are part of ongoing efforts to integrate minority voices into national politics, 
        though challenges remain. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s government is a complex system that combines parliamentary democracy with 
        substantial military influence. Administrative divisions reflect the country’s ethnic diversity, 
        and the role of ethnic groups in politics continues to shape governance, peace processes, 
        and national development.

    <h2>Language and Education</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar is a linguistically and culturally diverse country, with multiple languages, dialects, and 
        educational traditions. Language and education play central roles in preserving culture, promoting 
        literacy, and preparing citizens for modern life.
    </p>

    <h3>Major Languages and Dialects</h3>
    <p>
        The official language of Myanmar is <strong>Burmese (Myanmar language)</strong>, which is spoken 
        by the majority Bamar population and used in government, media, and education. Burmese has its 
        own script, derived from the ancient Pyu and Mon scripts, and serves as a unifying language 
        across the country.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to Burmese, Myanmar is home to over 100 languages spoken by various ethnic groups. 
        Major ethnic languages include <strong>Shan, Karen, Kachin (Jingpo), Chin, Mon, Rakhine, Kayah, 
        and Wa</strong>, among others. Many of these languages have unique scripts or writing systems 
        and are used in local education, religious practices, and cultural expression.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dialects vary widely, reflecting regional, ethnic, and cultural diversity. Efforts to preserve 
        minority languages are ongoing, especially in education and media.
    </p>

    <h3>Literacy and Schools</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar has made progress in literacy over the years, though challenges remain. The national 
        literacy rate is approximately 75–80%, with urban areas generally higher than rural regions. 
        Education is compulsory from primary through middle school, and the school system includes 
        public, private, and monastic schools. Monastic schools provide free education and moral 
        instruction, particularly in rural and underserved areas.
    </p>
    <p>
        Secondary and higher education include general schools, technical schools, and universities. 
        Key universities, such as the University of Yangon and Mandalay University, provide higher 
        education in sciences, arts, medicine, and engineering. Despite improvements, challenges 
        include uneven access, insufficient funding, and regional disparities.
    </p>

    <h3>Traditional vs Modern Education</h3>
    <p>
        Traditional education in Myanmar emphasized religion, moral values, and practical skills. 
        Monastic schools taught Buddhism, reading, writing, and community ethics, while apprenticeships 
        provided vocational knowledge in farming, crafts, and trade. The focus was on cultivating wisdom, 
        discipline, and ethical behavior rather than formal examinations or certificates.
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern education introduced by the British emphasized standardized curricula, examinations, and 
        English language proficiency. Today, Myanmar’s education system blends traditional values with 
        modern schooling. Students learn core subjects like mathematics, science, literature, and technology 
        while also maintaining cultural and moral education. There is growing interest in improving 
        teaching methods, digital learning, and critical thinking skills to align with global standards.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s linguistic diversity and educational traditions reflect its rich cultural 
        heritage. The coexistence of traditional monastic education and modern schools provides a unique 
        framework for learning, preparing students to navigate both cultural values and contemporary challenges.

    <h2>Environment and Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar is blessed with rich natural environments, diverse ecosystems, and abundant biodiversity. 
        Its geography includes mountains, forests, rivers, and coastal areas, which support a wide range 
        of plant and animal life. The environment plays a crucial role in sustaining livelihoods, culture, 
        and economic activities.
    </p>

    <h3>Forests, Mountains, and Rivers</h3>
    <p>
        Forests cover roughly one-third of Myanmar’s land area. They are home to teak, hardwoods, and 
        bamboo, and provide habitat for countless species. The northern and western regions are 
        mountainous, including the Himalayan foothills, Kachin Hills, Shan Plateau, and Arakan Mountains. 
        These highlands influence rainfall patterns, river flow, and soil fertility.
    </p>
    <p>
        Myanmar has several major rivers, such as the <strong>Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy)</strong>, 
        <strong>Chindwin</strong>, <strong>Salween</strong>, <strong>Mali</strong>, and <strong>N’Mai</strong>. 
        These rivers are vital for agriculture, transportation, and fisheries, supporting millions of people. 
        The river valleys and plains are fertile and sustain rice cultivation, while mountain streams 
        feed into the larger rivers, maintaining ecosystems.
    </p>

    <h3>National Parks and Wildlife</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar is home to numerous national parks and wildlife sanctuaries that protect its unique flora 
        and fauna. Notable protected areas include <strong>Hlawga National Park</strong>, 
        <strong>Kyaiktiyo Wildlife Sanctuary</strong>, <strong>Inle Lake Protected Area</strong>, 
        and <strong>Hukaung Valley Wildlife Sanctuary</strong>. These areas conserve endangered species, 
        including tigers, elephants, clouded leopards, Asiatic black bears, and rare bird species. 
        Rivers, wetlands, and forests provide habitats for freshwater fish, migratory birds, and other 
        wildlife crucial to ecological balance.
    </p>

    <h3>Environmental Issues</h3>
    <p>
        Myanmar faces several environmental challenges despite its natural wealth. 
        <strong>Deforestation</strong> is a major issue, caused by logging, agricultural expansion, 
        and infrastructure development. This threatens wildlife habitats, contributes to soil erosion, 
        and affects local communities. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Flooding</strong> is another concern, especially during the monsoon season. Rivers can 
        overflow, affecting farms, towns, and cities. Other issues include <strong>water pollution</strong>, 
        <strong>loss of biodiversity</strong>, and the impact of climate change on agriculture and coastal 
        regions. Conservation efforts by the government, NGOs, and local communities aim to mitigate 
        these challenges, preserve forests, and protect endangered species.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s environment and biodiversity are among its most valuable assets. Its forests, 
        mountains, rivers, national parks, and wildlife make it ecologically rich, while ongoing conservation 
        efforts are essential to address environmental challenges and sustain natural resources for future generations.
