    <h2>Geography</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar, also known as Burma, is a country located in Southeast Asia, bordered by 
        India and Bangladesh to the west, China to the north and northeast, Laos and Thailand 
        to the east and southeast, and the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea to the south and southwest. 
        The country covers an area of approximately 676,000 square kilometers, making it the 
        largest country in mainland Southeast Asia.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mountains:</strong> Myanmar is a mountainous country, especially in the north and west. 
        The northern region features the Himalayan foothills and the Kachin Hills, including 
        the Hkakabo Razi, which is the highest peak in Myanmar and Southeast Asia at 5,881 meters. 
        In the west, the Arakan Mountains (Rakhine Yoma) run parallel to the coast. The Shan Plateau 
        in the east is a highland region with rolling hills and deep valleys. These mountains 
        influence the climate and river systems of the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rivers:</strong> Myanmar has many important rivers that sustain its agriculture, 
        transportation, and ecosystems. The <strong>Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River</strong> is the 
        main river, flowing from north to south through the central plains and emptying into the 
        Andaman Sea. The <strong>Chindwin River</strong>, the largest tributary of the Ayeyarwady, 
        flows through the northwestern region. Other major rivers include the <strong>Salween River</strong>, 
        which runs along the eastern border with Thailand, and the <strong>Mali and N’Mai Rivers</strong> 
        in Kachin State, which merge to form the Ayeyarwady. These rivers support rich biodiversity 
        and fertile farmlands.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Plains:</strong> The central region of Myanmar consists of fertile plains along the 
        Ayeyarwady River. This area is the heart of agriculture, producing rice, pulses, and vegetables. 
        It is also home to most of the country’s population, including major cities like Mandalay 
        and Yangon. The plains are relatively flat, surrounded by mountains on all sides, which 
        provides natural protection and a favorable environment for farming.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Climate:</strong> Myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate, characterized by three main seasons. 
        The <em>hot season</em> occurs from March to May, with temperatures often exceeding 35°C. 
        The <em>rainy season</em>, caused by the southwest monsoon, lasts from June to October, bringing 
        heavy rainfall, especially to coastal and northern mountainous areas. The <em>cool season</em> 
        occurs from November to February, with milder temperatures and drier weather. The northern 
        highlands experience cooler climates, while the southern coastal regions are warm and humid 
        year-round.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Regions:</strong> Myanmar can be divided into several geographic regions. The <em>northern 
        mountains</em> include the Himalayan foothills and Kachin Hills. The <em>central plains</em> along 
        the Ayeyarwady are the agricultural heartland. The <em>eastern Shan Plateau</em> is hilly and less 
        populated. The <em>western coastal strip</em> includes the Rakhine coast and the Arakan Mountains. 
        The <em>southern peninsula</em> is narrow, tropical, and rich in forests, beaches, and islands. 
        These regions influence the economy, culture, and settlement patterns of the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s geography is diverse, from towering mountains and highlands to fertile plains, 
        long rivers, and tropical coasts. This diversity affects the climate, population distribution, 
        agriculture, and transportation networks, making Myanmar a country with unique natural and cultural 
        landscapes.

    <h2>Ethnic Groups</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in Southeast Asia, with over 
        135 recognized ethnic groups. These groups are broadly categorized into eight major 
        “national races,” each with distinct languages, traditions, and cultures. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Bamar (Burman):</strong> The Bamar people are the largest ethnic group, 
        making up about two-thirds of the population. They primarily live in the central plains 
        along the Ayeyarwady River. The Bamar language is the official language of Myanmar, 
        and their culture heavily influences the country’s traditions, Buddhism, and governance. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Shan:</strong> The Shan are a Tai ethnic group living mainly in Shan State in 
        the northeast. They speak the Shan language and practice Theravada Buddhism. Shan culture 
        includes colorful festivals, traditional music, and hilltop villages surrounded by rice fields. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Karen (Kayin):</strong> The Karen people are concentrated in Kayin State in 
        southeastern Myanmar. Major subgroups include the Sgaw and Pwo. The Karen language has 
        several dialects, and Christianity and Buddhism are both practiced among them. The Karen 
        have a strong tradition of weaving, folk songs, and oral storytelling. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rakhine (Arakanese):</strong> Rakhine people live along the western coast in 
        Rakhine State. They speak the Rakhine language, a dialect of Burmese, and follow 
        Theravada Buddhism. Rakhine culture includes distinctive architecture, traditional festivals, 
        and coastal fishing practices. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mon:</strong> The Mon people live mainly in Mon State in the southeast. 
        They are one of the earliest groups to adopt Theravada Buddhism in Myanmar. 
        The Mon language has its own script, and Mon culture includes classical dance, music, 
        and temple architecture. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kachin:</strong> The Kachin people live in the northernmost Kachin State. 
        Subgroups include Jingpo and Rawang. They speak various languages and practice Christianity 
        and traditional animist beliefs. Kachin culture includes festivals, traditional dress, 
        and weaving. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Chin:</strong> The Chin people live mainly in Chin State in the west. 
        They speak multiple languages and dialects, and many practice Christianity. 
        Chin culture emphasizes handicrafts, weaving, and traditional ceremonies. 
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Kayah (Karenni):</strong> Kayah people live in Kayah State in eastern Myanmar. 
        Subgroups include Kayah and Padaung. They are known for their distinctive woven textiles, 
        traditional houses, and cultural festivals. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Other smaller ethnic groups include the Wa, Lisu, Pa-O, Danu, Gurkha, and many more, 
        each with unique languages, clothing, festivals, and traditions. Many ethnic groups 
        celebrate annual harvest festivals, maintain traditional weaving and handicraft skills, 
        and preserve oral histories and folk songs. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s ethnic diversity creates a rich tapestry of languages, customs, 
        religions, and traditions. This diversity influences the country’s festivals, clothing, 
        cuisine, and social life, making Myanmar culturally vibrant and unique.

    <h2>Cities</h2>
    <p>
        Myanmar has several major cities, each with unique roles in politics, culture, trade, 
        and history. These cities are centers of population, administration, commerce, and culture.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Naypyidaw:</strong> Naypyidaw is the capital city of Myanmar, officially designated 
        in 2005. Located in the central part of the country, it is known for its wide roads, 
        modern government buildings, and planned layout. Naypyidaw serves as the political and 
        administrative center, housing the parliament, ministries, and embassies. Despite its 
        size, the city has a relatively low population density compared to Yangon or Mandalay.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Yangon:</strong> Yangon, formerly Rangoon, is Myanmar’s largest city and 
        commercial hub. Located near the Yangon River in the south, it has the busiest seaport, 
        international airports, and a strong business sector. Yangon is famous for the 
        <em>Shwedagon Pagoda</em>, colonial architecture, bustling markets, and diverse population. 
        It is a center of culture, education, and trade.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Mandalay:</strong> Mandalay, in central Myanmar, is the country’s second-largest 
        city and cultural heart. It was the last royal capital before British colonization. 
        Mandalay is known for its monasteries, universities, crafts, and arts, especially 
        gold leaf production and traditional weaving. It is a gateway to northern Myanmar, 
        including the Shan and Kachin regions.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Other notable cities:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mawlamyine:</strong> Located in Mon State, it is known for colonial 
                architecture, river ports, and nearby beaches.</li>
            <li><strong>Taunggyi:</strong> Capital of Shan State, famous for the annual 
                <em>Hot Air Balloon Festival</em> and nearby Inle Lake.</li>
            <li><strong>Pyay:</strong> Historical city in the central plains, with ancient 
                Pyu ruins and fertile farmland.</li>
            <li><strong>Myitkyina:</strong> Capital of Kachin State in the north, important 
                for trade and river transport along the Irrawaddy and N’Mai rivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Bago:</strong> Located near Yangon, historically significant as a 
                former Mon kingdom with famous pagodas.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        In summary, Myanmar’s cities vary from political capitals and commercial hubs to 
        cultural centers and historic towns. Together, they form the backbone of the 
        country’s administration, economy, and cultural identity.
