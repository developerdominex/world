    <section id="history">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Judaism traces its origins over 3,000 years ago in the ancient Near East. Its foundational figure is Abraham, regarded as the first patriarch, who entered into a covenant with God. Moses is another central figure, traditionally credited with leading the Israelites out of Egypt and receiving the Torah, the sacred law. Over centuries, Jewish communities spread across the world, maintaining religious and cultural identity despite periods of persecution and diaspora.
