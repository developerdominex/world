        <h1>Global Economy</h1>
        <p>The global economy encompasses the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services across countries. It is shaped by trade, policies, industries, and international cooperation.</p>

        <h2>General Economic Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Economic policies worldwide aim to promote sustainable growth, reduce unemployment, control inflation, and ensure stability. Governments use fiscal policy, including taxation and government spending, and monetary policy, such as interest rates and money supply management, to influence economic activity. International organizations like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank also provide guidance, financial support, and policy recommendations to promote global stability and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Policies vary by country depending on economic structure, development level, and social priorities. Developed nations often focus on innovation, technological advancement, and maintaining competitive markets, while developing countries emphasize poverty reduction, infrastructure development, and attracting foreign investment. Global agreements, such as trade treaties and climate accords, influence economic decisions and cooperation between nations.

        <h2>Global Economy</h2>
        <p>
            The global economy is interconnected, with trade, finance, and supply chains linking nations. Key economic powers include the United States, China, the European Union, Japan, and emerging economies such as India and Brazil. These countries drive global production, consumption, and innovation. International trade allows countries to specialize in industries where they are most efficient, increasing overall productivity and wealth.
        </p>
        <p>
            Global economic growth is affected by factors like technological advancement, population growth, natural resources, and geopolitical stability. Economic crises, such as recessions or financial collapses, can have worldwide effects due to globalization. Similarly, innovations in energy, digital technology, and transportation continue to reshape global markets and production systems.

        <h2>Other Economic Topics</h2>
        <p>
            Several challenges and opportunities shape the modern economy. Income inequality, poverty, climate change, and access to education are major social-economic issues. Automation, artificial intelligence, and globalization are changing labor markets, requiring adaptation in skills and workforce policies. Sustainable development and green energy are increasingly integrated into economic planning to balance growth with environmental protection.
        </p>
        <p>
            International cooperation is vital for addressing global economic issues. Organizations like the World Trade Organization (WTO) regulate trade, while multinational agreements support economic collaboration and conflict resolution. Investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and technology are key drivers of development, particularly in emerging economies. Globalization has created new opportunities for business, innovation, and cultural exchange, but also demands careful management of resources and regulation of financial markets.
